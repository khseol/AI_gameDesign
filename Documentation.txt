The progress of the game so far was to develop the player and the controller for the player with original artwork.
The basic core mechanic of the player is to move around using the directional key strokes of: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT.
As stated in my game proposal, the game will be similar in gameplay to that of Bomberman. The control to set the 'Breakers' up are:
'A' for long range
'D' for short range

The AI implementation of the game will mostly be put towards to the NPCs. Their basic function will to search and destroy
the target for as long as there is time on the clock.
A lot have not been implemented as of yet since i wanted to take much care of the details for the playable character and the 
basic core mechanics of the character and the nuances of the breakers' attributes of being set for a limited amount of time.

There are obstacles in the game environment for the player to collide with, as well it is being used fopr testing purposes of how the action 
of the actual explosion should fit inside a dynamically designed environment.
